Just a Snake Game in JavaScript to learn jest and github actions by project building

### Phase 1: Setting Up the Game Canvas

1. Create an HTML file (index.html) to hold the game.
2. Set up the basic structure of the HTML file with a canvas element where the game will be displayed.
3. Link a JavaScript file (js/snake-game-core.js) to handle the game logic.

### Phase 2: Drawing the Snake

1. Create variables to represent the snake's initial position, size, and direction.
2. Write a function to draw the snake on the canvas.
3. Implement basic keyboard controls to change the snake's direction.

### Phase 3: Adding Movement and Collision Detection

1. Implement movement logic to update the snake's position based on its direction.
2. Add collision detection to check if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
3. Handle game over conditions when collisions occur.

### Phase 4: Adding Scoring and Game Reset

1. Implement scoring to track the player's progress.
2. Add functionality to reset the game after the player completes it or when the game ends.

### Phase 5: Adding Speed Increment and Obstacles

1. Implement speed increment functionality to increase the speed of the snake as the player's score increases.
2. Introduce obstacles on the game board that the snake must avoid while collecting food.

### Phase 6: Adding Sound Effects and Visual Effects

1. Incorporate sound effects for snake movement, food collection, and game over events.
2. Add visual effects to enhance the game's appearance, such as smooth snake movement or food spawning animations.
